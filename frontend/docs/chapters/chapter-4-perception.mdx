# Chapter 4: Perception in Robotics (Vision, Touch, Proprioception)

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the fundamental principles of robotic perception systems
- Analyze different sensory modalities and their roles in robot awareness
- Explain computer vision techniques used in robotics applications
- Describe tactile sensing and haptic feedback systems
- Evaluate proprioceptive sensing and its importance for embodied systems
- Assess the integration of multiple sensory modalities for robust perception

## Introduction

Perception is the cornerstone of intelligent behavior in physical AI systems, enabling robots to understand and interact meaningfully with their environment. Through sophisticated sensory systems, robots can detect objects, recognize patterns, navigate spaces, and manipulate physical entities. This chapter explores the three primary modalities of robotic perception: vision for distant sensing and scene understanding, touch for close-range interaction and manipulation, and proprioception for self-awareness and control. Understanding these perceptual systems is essential for developing robots that can operate autonomously and safely in complex, dynamic environments.

## Core Concepts
