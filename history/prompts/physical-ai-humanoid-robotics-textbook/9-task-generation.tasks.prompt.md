## Summary

Generated comprehensive task breakdown for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook system with 8 phases organized by user stories and priorities.

## Prompt Text

```
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Response Text

Created detailed tasks.md with 8 phases:

1. Phase 1: Setup (5 tasks) - Project initialization and basic structure
2. Phase 2: Foundational (14 tasks) - Core infrastructure that blocks all user stories
3. Phase 3: User Story 1 - Access Interactive Textbook Content (P1) (9 tasks)
4. Phase 4: User Story 2 - Get Personalized Learning Experience (P1) (9 tasks)
5. Phase 5: User Story 3 - Interact with AI-Powered Chatbot (P2) (9 tasks)
6. Phase 6: User Story 4 - Access Content in Multiple Languages (P2) (9 tasks)
7. Phase 7: User Story 5 - Create and Manage User Account (P3) (11 tasks)
8. Phase 8: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns (9 tasks)

Each task follows the required format: [ID] [P?] [Story?] Description with file paths.
Tasks are organized by user stories to enable independent implementation and testing.

## Outcome

Complete task breakdown with 70 individual tasks ready for implementation. Each user story can be developed independently with clear dependencies and parallel execution opportunities identified.

## Evaluation

All tasks follow the required checklist format with proper IDs, story labels where appropriate, and specific file paths. The organization by user stories enables incremental delivery and independent testing of each feature.ccwhich ccr
